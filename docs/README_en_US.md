## Features

- Real-time editing and browsing of book content.
- Supports multiple export formats, including command text files, mcfunction, and data packs.

## Notes

Refer to version 1.21.0's font system; other versions of Minecraft may experience slight misalignment issues.

Enabling "Force Unicode Font" in Minecraft, along with the same setting in this software, can resolve most alignment issues.
